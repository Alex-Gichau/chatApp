# About Chat Engine
Chat Engine's server uses Web Sockets and Rest APIs under the hood.

Before using the APIs, you must create an Account at ChatEngine.io, a Project under that Account, and at least one User within that Project.

You will need the Project ID, Private Key, User Name and User Secret to authenticate into these APIs. More on authentication below.
